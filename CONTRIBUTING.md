# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue,
email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Issue process

1. If you have a suggestion or encounter an unexpected behavior, please do not hesitate to report
   it by creating an issue.
2. Before doing any "fixing" work, you might want to wait for maintainter feedback as we might
   disagree or consider a bug to be either out of scope or working as expected.
3. Once the issue is mutually agreed upon, you can either propose a fix, or wait for us to do
   it ourselves. That might take a long time if we are too busy to take care of it immediately.
   However, we will strive to at least review proposed community improvements in a timely manner.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any change in behavior is agreed upon with maintainers, well-documented and tested.
2. Update the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) with details of changes to the interface ; 
   this includes any breaking or minor change. Add a reference to the Github issue relating to 
   this change as exemplified in this file.
3. Do not increase version numbers as `master` is always a snapshot and we will take care of the
   version update when we release and publish an artifact.
4. Please understand that we cannot dedicate ourselves to always reacting immediately to any
   request and that thus you might have to wait a little bit before we have a chance to look at
   pull requests. However, we will do our best to do so in a timely manner.
5. You understand that any code you submit falls under [the license of the project](./LICENSE.md).
